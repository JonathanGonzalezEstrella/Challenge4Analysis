Analysis Summary
We started with a district summary to give us the big picture—how many schools
and students we have, the total budget, and how everyone's doing in math and 
reading. Next, we looked at school by school to see how size, type, and money 
affect student success.

Key Metrics:
•	Number of schools and students.
•	How the budget's spread out across schools.
•	District-wide averages for math and reading scores.
•	Pass rates for math, reading, and both.
•	Conclusions and Comparisons

Size and Success: Our look into school size showed a clear pattern: smaller schools
with fewer than 1,000 students get better pass rates than the big ones with more 
than 2,000 students. The smaller setting means students get more attention and 
better resources, leading to higher success rates.
Money Matters, but It's How You Use It: When we checked out how spending affects 
performance, we found something interesting. Schools spending less per student (<$585) 
did better than the ones splashing out more (> $645) on each student. This shows that 
throwing more money at each student doesn't automatically make for better grades. What
counts is how wisely the money is used, including teaching quality and the curriculum.
What This Means for Policies and Schools
From what we've learned, there are a couple of smart moves to make. First, reducing 
the student-to-teacher ratio could help, especially in larger schools. Second, it might
be time to rethink how we allocate budgets to ensure we're investing in ways that boost
learning, not just up the spending per student.
Wrapping Up
Funding is vital, but it's not just about how much cash schools have—it's about how they 
use it and the learning environment they create. As we move forward, blending the numbers 
and the quality of education will be vital in giving students the best chance to succeed.
